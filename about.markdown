Currently employed at the University of Notre Dame. I work primarily as a
full-stack Ruby on Rails developer with side projects in Python data engineering.
Sometimes I upgrade Tableau Server, but don't tell anyone.

In my free time I Forever-DM Dungeons and Dragons with my closest friends, run to stay active, maintain the best lawn on the block, and cheer for Notre Dame Football.

My development environment of choice is macOS running docker-compose edited with Github's Atom.
