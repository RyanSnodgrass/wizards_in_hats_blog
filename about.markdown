Testing Github API

I work remotely for [Grio](grio.com), a web dev shop making web apps for clients.
I focus primarily on Ruby on Rails applications, with a bit of Angular, React, Docker, and AWS thrown in.

In my free time I Forever-DM Dungeons and Dragons with my closest friends, run to stay active, maintain the best lawn on the block, and cheer for Notre Dame Football.

My development environment of choice is macOS running docker-compose edited with Github's Atom.
